In this chapter, we begin with presenting the necessary background to understand the deep convolutional neural network (deep CNN) and data reduction methods, as well as, other ideas required to understand our research method.  In the next section we we start with the structure of CNN and the gradient descent training procedure. We then discuss the modern research outputs that can speed up the training procedure and outline their deficiencies. Next, we review the data reduction literature and present a CNN data reduction framework - use the network pre-trained on ImageNet to extract low-dimensional features and run the data reduction methods on extracted features. Furthermore, we cover the existing trade-off framework in the context of maximum-likelihood estimation machine learning algorithms and explain why it is not suitable for deep neural network. Finally, we present TAPAS \cite{Istrate2019}, which is an accuracy predictor for deep neural network without training and has several properties that make it useful to build our trade-off framework.
