Moreover, according to the Google Data Labelling Service, it costs 35\$ to label 50,000 images for classification tasks. The price goes to 870\$ for segmentation tasks. It would cost a lot to build a large datasets with millions of images. If we could extend the pipeline to predict the amount of data needed to achieve a accuracy level, we may save the sponsor a huge amount of money.
