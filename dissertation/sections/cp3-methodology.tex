In this chapter, we begin by presenting the pre-processing feature extraction process for image dataset. Next we adapt three methods overviewed in Chapter \ref{bg} to reduce the size of image dataset, called the Patterns by Ordered Projections (POP) \cite{Riquelme2003a}, Enhanced Global Density-based Instance Selection (EGDIS) \cite{Malhat2020}, and Curriculum Learning (CL) \cite{Hacohen2019a}. Then we propose our weighted data reduction method, called Weighted Curriculum Learning (WCL), based on CL scores and the EGDIS selected boundary instances. We also illustrate the selection patterns with three generated blob datasets, which correspond to the 2-dimensional special case of extracted image feature space. After that, our work is focused on the comprehensive evaluation of the methods. We describe image augmentation algorithms and the details of the DenseNet architecture \cite{Huang2017} and incremental training \cite{Istrate2017}. We also describe the model fitting procedure of the SVM-baseline.
